## Key Features

## 1. Key Metrics

The dashboard focuses on a set of vital metrics that drive the procurement analysis. These include:

Total Procurement Cost: 2.22bn across various projects.

Projects Count 10K ongoing and completed projects.

Total Orders: 25M procurement orders processed.

Reorders: 3M representing additional orders made to meet ongoing project demands.

Suppliers: 20 active suppliers are involved in the procurement process.

On-Time Deliveries: 74.91% reflecting the efficiency of the procurement chain in delivering materials within the expected timeline.

These metrics provide a birdâ€™s-eye view of procurement activities and help identify areas for cost-saving and efficiency improvements.

## 2. Detailed Dashboard Breakdown

Total Units Ordered by Location

## The bar chart represents the procurement activity across three key locations:

Dubai: 8.8 million units ordered.
Sharjah: 8.5 million units ordered.
Abu Dhabi: 8.2 million units ordered.
This chart helps assess material distribution across major operational hubs, allowing for optimization of logistics and planning.

## Average Price of Top 5 Materials

A comparison of the average prices of the most procured materials:

Steel: 799 per unit (the highest-priced material).

Cement: 90 per unit.

Safety Equipment: 85 per unit.

Glass: 35 per unit.

Tiles: 27 per unit.

This analysis enables the procurement team to focus on managing high-cost materials, optimizing supplier contracts, and considering bulk purchasing strategies for cost savings.

## Month-wise Order Trend
A line chart showing the monthly trend of orders placed for key construction materials:

Bricks, Cement, Glass, Paint, and Safety Equipment show fluctuating demand throughout the year, peaking in certain months, such as August and December with significant material orders.
This insight allows for better forecasting of material needs based on seasonal trends, ensuring timely order placements and preventing delays in project completion.

## Storage Utilization
A pie chart showing the division of materials by storage categories:

Open-air: 32.97% of materials are stored in open-air facilities.

Climate-controlled: 33.76% are stored in climate-controlled environments.

Covered Storage: 33.27% are stored in covered storage.

This data helps facility managers optimize warehouse space utilization, ensuring materials are stored appropriately to avoid damage or loss.

## Payment Status
A donut chart visualizing the payment statuses of procurement orders:

Paid: 34.65% of orders have been paid.

Pending: 31.91% are still awaiting payment.

Overdue: 33.44% represent overdue payments.

This information assists the finance and procurement teams in addressing overdue payments promptly, improving supplier relationships, and avoiding delays due to unpaid invoices.

## Material Distribution by Type
This pie chart breaks down the distribution of materials procured across different categories such as:

Bricks, Glass, Wood, Cement, Paint, Steel, and others.

Reordered Materials

A chart showing the percentage of materials reordered to maintain stock levels and project continuity:

Steel: 10.53%
Bricks: 11.5%
Paint: 11.4%
Safety Equipment: 11.03%
Procurement Status

## A stacked bar chart displaying the procurement statuses:

Delivered: 6.5M units delivered.

Cancelled: 645K units.

Pending: 629K units.

In-progress: 624K units.

## Material Procurement Overview by Supplier
A detailed table showing procurement statistics for major suppliers, including:

Count of Quantity: Number of units ordered per material type.

Average Unit Price: Price per unit for each material type.

Sum of Total Cost: Total cost for procurement from each supplier.

This overview enables procurement teams to assess supplier performance, price competitiveness, and material cost management.

## 3. Filters and Slicers
The dashboard includes several filters and slicers to allow users to dynamically interact with the data:

Location Filter: Drill down into procurement data by location (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah).

Project Type Filter: Analyze data for Commercial, Mixed-use, or Residential projects.

Supplier Filter: Filter data by specific suppliers.

Month Filter: Examine procurement activities for specific months.

Procurement Status Filter: View data based on the procurement order status (Delivered, Cancelled, Pending, In-progress).

These filters provide the flexibility to focus on specific aspects of the procurement process, ensuring a more tailored analysis.

## Data Source and Structure
The data for this project was sourced from internal procurement databases, containing key fields such as:

Material Type, Order Date, Location, Supplier, Quantity, Unit Price, Total Cost, Storage Category, Payment Status, Procurement Status, 

## Data Table Structure:

Inventory ID, Project ID, Material Type, Quantity, Unit Price, Supplier Details, Payment Status, Procurement Status, Storage Details, Order Dates (Expected, Actual), 

This structured data was loaded into Power BI and transformed using Power Query to clean, shape, and model the data for visualization.

## Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
Power Query: Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculating KPIs and advanced metrics.
Excel: Used for initial data collection and structuring.

## How to Use the Dashboard
